Wow! I love blogging so much already.

Did you know that "despite its name, salted duck eggs can also be made from
chicken eggs, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the
egg yolk will be less rich."?
([Wikipedia Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg))

Yeah, I didn't either.


```python
#@save
def box_corner_to_center(boxes):
    """Convert from (upper_left, bottom_right) to (center, width, height)"""
    x1, y1, x2, y2 = boxes[:, 0], boxes[:, 1], boxes[:, 2], boxes[:, 3]
    cx = (x1 + x2) / 2
    cy = (y1 + y2) / 2
    w = x2 - x1
    h = y2 - y1
    boxes = torch.stack((cx, cy, w, h), axis=-1)
    return boxes

#@save
def box_center_to_corner(boxes):
    """Convert from (center, width, height) to (upper_left, bottom_right)"""
    cx, cy, w, h = boxes[:, 0], boxes[:, 1], boxes[:, 2], boxes[:, 3]
    x1 = cx - 0.5 * w
    y1 = cy - 0.5 * h
    x2 = cx + 0.5 * w
    y2 = cy + 0.5 * h
    boxes = torch.stack((x1, y1, x2, y2), axis=-1)
    return boxes
```
